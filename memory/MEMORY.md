# Coco Memory

This folder is the markdown memory anchor for coco.

Guidelines:
- Keep stable facts here. Do not store transient chat noise.
- Prefer short, explicit bullet points over long paragraphs.
- Update timestamps when facts change.
- Link to Obsidian notes for deeper context.

Core files:
- `memory/user_profile.md`
- `memory/response_style.md`
- `memory/project_context.md`

Obsidian:
- Configure `memory.obsidian_vault` in `~/.coco.yaml`.
- coco will search both this folder and the Obsidian vault.
